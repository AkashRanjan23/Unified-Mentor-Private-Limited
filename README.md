This repository showcases various data science and analytics projects I've completed using different tools and techniques. Each project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, model building, visualization, and analysis. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. Amazon Sales Dashboard
- **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive overview of various sales metrics for the year 2017 compared to 2016.
- **Key Metrics:** Total revenue, profit, online and offline sales, units sold.
- **Revenue Breakdown:** Detailed breakdown by item type, region, and sales channels.
- **Profit Analysis:** Monthly, yearly, and quarterly profit analysis.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Year and quarter wise revenue analysis.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Tableau for dashboard creation and visualization.

### 2. Bird Strike Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze bird strike data to identify trends, patterns, and insights to mitigate the risks associated with bird strikes.
- **Data Preparation:** Initial data exploration, handling missing values, data cleaning, and conversion of date formats.
- **Data Analysis and Visualizations:** Generated various visualizations such as pie charts, correlation heatmaps, bar charts, and line charts to illustrate bird strike statistics, trends, and actions taken by airplane companies.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 3. Heart Disease Prediction
- **Objective:** Develop a model to predict heart disease using health-related features.
- **Dataset Overview:** Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The target variable indicates the presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzed the distribution of features and the target variable, identified an imbalance in the target variable.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Tested various models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Network.
- **Best Model:** Random Forest selected as the best model with an accuracy of 83.61%, precision of 78.79%, recall of 89.66%, F1-score of 83.87%, and ROC-AUC of 87.88%.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 4. Crop Production Analytical Dashboard
- **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive overview of crop production metrics, including total area covered, total production, area covered by district, state-wise crop production, year-wise production, and production by crop and district.
- **Dashboard Components:** Visualizations of total area covered, total production, area covered by district, state-wise crop production, year-wise production, and production by crop.
- **Insights:** Trends in crop production, geographic distribution, and district-level data analysis.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Tableau for dashboard creation and visualization.

### 5. Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard
- **Objective:** Provide a detailed view of employee attrition metrics within a company to understand patterns and factors contributing to employee turnover.
- **Key Metrics:** Total employees, active employees, total attrition, attrition rate, average employee age.
- **Attrition Analysis:** Breakdown of attrition data by gender, department, education, job role, marital status, and years worked.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Tableau for dashboard creation and visualization.

## Conclusion
